#### Programming Paradigms  
~~~ 
Never use the phrase “programming language paradigm.”
A paradigm is a way of doing something (like programming), not a concrete thing (like a language). 
Now, it’s true that if a programming language L happens to make a particular programming paradigm 
P easy to express, then we often say “L is a P language” (e.g. “Haskell is a functional programming 
language”) but that does not mean there is any such thing as a “functional language paradigm”.
~~~

### Declarative: 
- Functional: (Applicative): Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.
- Dataflow
- Logic, Constraint-based.
- Template-based
- Structured  
### Imperative: 
- Von Neumann
- Interpreted (Scripting)
- Object-oriented

### Declarative programming: 
~~~
is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation(What do) without describing its control flow(How do). Some well-
known examples of declarative domain specific languages (DSLs) include CSS, regular expressions, and a subset of SQL (SELECT queries,
for example) Many markup languages such as HTML, MXML, XAML, XSLT... are often declarative. The declarative programming try to blur the
distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer.

#### - Functional:
The functional programming paradigms has its roots in mathematics and it is language independent. The key principal of this paradigms is the execution of series of mathematical functions. The central model for the abstraction is the function which are meant for some specific computation and not the data structure. Data are loosely coupled to functions.The function hide their implementation. Function can be replaced with their values without changing the meaning of the program. Some of the languages like perl, javascript mostly uses this paradigm.

#### - Dataflow
In computer programming, dataflow programming is a programming paradigm that models a program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing dataflow principles and architecture. Dataflow programming languages share some features of functional languages, and were generally developed in order to bring some functional concepts to a language more suitable for numeric processing. Some authors use the term datastream instead of dataflow to avoid confusion with dataflow computing or dataflow architecture.

#### - Logic
It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc. In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. In normal programming languages, such concept of knowledge base is not available but while using the concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning we have some models like Perception model which is using the same mechanism.

#### - sructured
Structured programming is a kind of imperative programming where control flow is defined by nested loops,
conditionals,and subroutines, rather than via gotos. Variables are generally local to blocks (have lexical scope)

### Imperative programming:
~~~
is a programming paradigm that describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state. 
The declarative programs  can be dually viewed as programming commands or mathematical assertions.
~~~
#### - Object-oriented
OOP is based on the sending of messages to objects. Objects respond to messages by performing operations, generally called methods. Messages can have arguments. A society of objects, each with their own local memory and own set of operations has a different feel than the monolithic processor and single shared memory feel of non object oriented languages.

#### - Interpreted (Scripting)
An interpreted program, sometimes called a script , is a program whose instructions are actually a logically sequenced series of operating system commands, handled one at a time by a command interpreter . In turn, the command interpreter requests services from the operating system. The writer of the interpreted program need not be concerned by low-level storage management considerations. On the other hand, an interpreted program can not be as efficient as a compiled program, which has been processed by a language compiler. A language compiler converts source statements into something close to the strings of 0's and 1's that a processor ultimately is given to work on. Because this work is already done before a compiled program is run, it runs much more quickly.
