### Describe concepts and characteristics of the classification of programming paradigms:
#### Programming Paradigms  
~~~ 
Never use the phrase “programming language paradigm.”
A paradigm is a way of doing something (like programming), not a concrete thing (like a language). 
Now, it’s true that if a programming language L happens to make a particular programming paradigm 
P easy to express, then we often say “L is a P language” (e.g. “Haskell is a functional programming 
language”) but that does not mean there is any such thing as a “functional language paradigm”.
~~~

### Declarative: Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it.
- Functional
- Dataflow
- Logic, Constraint-based.
- Template-based
- Structured  
### Imperative: Programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state.
- Von Neumann
- Interpreted (Scripting)
- Object-oriented
