## Describe concepts and characteristics of the classification of programming paradigms:

### Declarative
- Functional
- Dataflow
- Logic, Constraint-based.
- Template-based
- Structured  
### Imperative
- Von Neumann
- Interpreted (Scripting)
- Object-oriented


### Programming Paradigms  
~~~ 
Never use the phrase “programming language paradigm.”
A paradigm is a way of doing something (like programming), not a concrete thing (like a language). Now, it’s true that if a programming language L happens to make a particular programming paradigm P easy to express, then we often say “L is a P language” (e.g. “Haskell is a functional programming language”) but that does not mean there is any such thing as a “functional language paradigm”.
