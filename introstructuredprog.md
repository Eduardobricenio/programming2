#### Programming Paradigms  
~~~ 
Never use the phrase “programming language paradigm.”
A paradigm is a way of doing something (like programming), not a concrete thing (like a language). 
Now, it’s true that if a programming language L happens to make a particular programming paradigm 
P easy to express, then we often say “L is a P language” (e.g. “Haskell is a functional programming 
language”) but that does not mean there is any such thing as a “functional language paradigm”.

### Declarative: 
- Functional: (Applicative): Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.
- Dataflow
- Logic, Constraint-based.
- Template-based
- Structured  
### Imperative: 
- Von Neumann
- Interpreted (Scripting)
- Object-oriented

### Declarative programming: 
is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation(What do) without describing its control flow(How do). Some well-known examples of declarative domain specific languages (DSLs) include CSS, regular expressions, and a subset of SQL (SELECT queries, for example) Many markup languages such as HTML, MXML, XAML, XSLT... are often declarative. The declarative programming try to blur the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer.

### Imperative programming:
is a programming paradigm that describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state. The declarative programs can be dually viewed as programming commands or mathematical assertions.
